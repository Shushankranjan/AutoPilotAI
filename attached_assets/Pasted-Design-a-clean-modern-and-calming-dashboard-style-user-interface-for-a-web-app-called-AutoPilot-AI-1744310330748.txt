Design a clean, modern, and calming dashboard-style user interface for a web app called AutoPilot AI – Your Smart Daily Planner. The primary goal of this UI is to help users generate AI-powered daily task schedules based on their mood, available time, and goals. The app should feel supportive, intelligent, and slightly personal — like a productivity buddy, not just a cold planner.
